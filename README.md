# Data Analysis Using SQL
At Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company), a research project was created to explore the historical employee data from the 1980s and 1990s using PostgreSQL. The project involved three primary phases: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. The data source for this project was comprised of six CSV files containing department numbers, employee information, salaries, titles, employee departments, and department managers. A SQL database was created with six tables to accommodate the data source. After database creation, data were loaded into the SQL database for analysis. The project aimed to construct SQL database system, import legacy CSV files into the database, and extract valuable insights from the employee dataset.

## Data Modeling: 
This phase focused on designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to conceptualize the database structure. It established relationships between employee-related entities, depicting how different data elements were interconnected.

## Data Engineering:
Subsequent to the data modeling phase, tables were created in a SQL database based on the ERD. This involved defining table schemas, data types, and relationships. The legacy CSV files containing employee data from the 1980s and 1990s were imported into the respective tables, ensuring data consistency.

## Data Analysis (Executing Queries):
In the final phase, SQL queries were crafted to extract meaningful insights from the organized database. Queries were designed to retrieve specific information, including employee details by last names or departments, frequency counts, tenure periods, and other relevant analyses of the historical employee data.
